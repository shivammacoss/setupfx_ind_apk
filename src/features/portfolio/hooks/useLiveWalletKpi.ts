/**
 * Live-derived wallet KPIs.
 *
 * Why this hook exists: `/user/wallet/summary` polls every 10 s and
 * `/positions/pnl-summary` every 5 s — too slow for the trader's
 * perception. We need MARGIN USED / M2M to react the same frame as the
 * buy/sell or close tap, and to match the per-position card on screen.
 *
 *   available + used → wallet/summary cache, patched optimistically by
 *                      usePlaceOrder.onMutate + close mutations so the
 *                      strip moves on the same frame as the tap.
 *
 *   m2m → Σ (position.unrealized_pnl + position.realized_pnl) across
 *         every OPEN position. This is the EXACT same calc PortfolioScreen
 *         uses to build the per-row `pnl` field that the position card
 *         and TOTAL P&L card show. Same data source = guaranteed
 *         agreement — no more "card says +31.48, M2M says -0.01" mismatch.
 *
 *         We tried recomputing M2M client-side from live WS ticks
 *         (`(ltp − avg) × qty`) so it would animate tick-by-tick. The
 *         catch: backend may apply FX (USD-quoted instruments), use a
 *         different qty unit (contracts vs lots × lot_size), or run a
 *         legacy ×83 conversion — and our client-side math has no way to
 *         know which path the server took. The 3 s positions poll
 *         delivers a refreshed `unrealized_pnl` from the server (already
 *         FX-aware), so we just sum that. M2M effectively updates every
 *         3 s instead of every tick — acceptable trade-off for never
 *         showing a wrong number.
 *
 *   ledger → available + used. Cash on deposit; ignores live P&L.
